# Python_and_Tableau
I completed a data analysis and visualization project for Value Inc, a global retail store that specializes in selling household items in bulk. The Sales Manager at Value Inc was facing challenges due to the lack of proper sales reporting, limited insights into current sales trends, and a lack of understanding about monthly costs, profits, and top-selling products.

In this project, I employed a combination of Python and Tableau to provide data-driven solutions to these challenges. I began by extracting data from an Excel spreadsheet, which contained valuable sales information. Using Python, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation to prepare the data for analysis.
